                <p>Lehigh University's Computer Science Capstone is a program of the Computer Science and Engineering Department.  The capstone is a requirement for all three of the department's Bachelor of Science programs:</p>
                <p>BS Engineering<br>
                  BS Arts and Sciences,<br>
                  BS Computer Science and Business</p>
                <p>All three BS programs are ABET-accredited.  In addition, the Computer Science and Business (CSB) program, one of Lehigh's intercollegiate programs, is also a fully accredited business program. Students who complete the CSB program are awarded a joint degree that comes from the Business and Engineering colleges.</p>
                <p>The Capstone Program is the culmination of the students' coursework at Lehigh, where they apply their skills working on high-impact projects for corporate sponsors. Sponsors have the opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest students Lehigh has to offer, while simultaneously contributing to their education.</p>
